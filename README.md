# BM25 Model Branch

This branch is related to the **BM25** stage of the dissertation. It contains all the necessary components for testing and running the BM25 model.

## Dataset

The dataset required for this stage is present in this repository, enabling full testing of the BM25 model without needing to retrieve external data.

## Running the Code

The only runnable file in this branch is:

BM25.py

This file executes the core BM25 logic for document retrieval and evaluation.

### Auxiliary Files

All other files in this branch are auxiliary classes that support the main **BM25.py** file and should not be run independently.
